### Image Classification using Simple CNN and Augmented CNN

**Project Overview**
This Jupyter Notebook aims to classify flower images into five categories: roses, daisy, dandelion, sunflowers, and tulips. Two approaches are compared: a simple CNN and an augmented CNN.

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of images categorized into five folders corresponding to the flower types.

**Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Images are loaded and preprocessed for both models.
2. **Simple CNN:** A basic convolutional neural network is created and trained on the dataset.
3. **Augmented CNN:** Data augmentation techniques are applied to the dataset, and a similar CNN architecture is trained on the augmented data.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Both models are evaluated on a test set to compare performance.

### Model Performance

| Model Type | Dataset | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| Simple CNN | Training | 99% |
| Augmented CNN | Training | 80% |
| Simple CNN | Test | 66% |
| Augmented CNN | Test | 72% |

**Notebook Structure**
* **Import Necessary Libraries:** Imports essential libraries like TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, etc.
* **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loads the dataset, performs necessary transformations, and splits data into training, validation, and test sets.
* **Simple CNN Model:** Defines the architecture of the simple CNN and trains it.
* **Augmented CNN Model:** Defines data augmentation techniques, creates an augmented dataset, and trains the augmented CNN.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates both models on the test set and compares performance metrics.

**Dependencies**
* TensorFlow/Keras
* OpenCV (optional, for image processing)
* Other necessary libraries

**Note:** This README will be updated as the project progresses.
